# CaptureTheFlag-UniversityFlensburg

This is a kotlin android app which i developed while enrolled in 'Mobile-Computing' course.
You can play a round of capture the flag with your friends if you are on our beatiful campus here in Flensburg.
It works through a bluetooth connection which discovers other players and their location.
One game master can set the flags and manage the lobby.
It is really beatiful designed by me and my comrades.

We only tested it in emulator and simulated the bluetooth connection.
But it should be fairly easy to create a apk.

## How to start the app ?
- Install AndroidStudio
- Clone project and open in AndroidStudio
- Create a emulation device with at least api level 30
- Start app in ide
- Enjoy our work :)
